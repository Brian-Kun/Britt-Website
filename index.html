            <h3>Dear Brittney,</h3>

            <p>Often times, I think life is unfair. Due to the fact that since I was born I was chopped in one half, and I lived my life thinking that I'll never find the other half of me, however, I was wrong. Because during the last three days of a thing called "summer session", I met my other half. But life is so unfair that she must test our love with countless months of separation by a thing called "distance". And even though patience is my forte, I cannot hold the anger and I wish I could punch life in the face. Because life makes me lose my patience while I think that my other half is gone. </p>

            <p> But Brittney, my love, that our story came to halt doesn't mean that we must give up on life. Because I will be happy as long as I don't lose contact with my other half. Because just knowing that you're okay will make me happy. Because you're a wonderful person, an incredible artist, and you deserve the best. And since you deserve the best, I made you this website. </p>

            <p>Feelings aside...</p>

            <p>I truly believe that you're an amazing photographer and you deserve to have millions of followers on your instagram. So I made this website so you can showcase your work. It works like this: Every time you upload a picture to instagram it would also automatically upload to this website, also this websites contains links to all your accounts of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and yes obviously Tumblr. Also every time someone likes your picture on instagram, it would automatically update the number of like on the website. As you can see if you scroll down, the like count in set to "0" and the caption "caption goes here" this is because this is just a demo.  If you would like the website to work properly I would need to have your instagram password.  </p>

            <p>This website is completely yours and you can do whatever you want with it. I can change anything you want; your wishes are my commands. I've worked on this personal project for a couple of months, and I hope you like it and take advantage of it. </p>

            <p>Happy Birthday Brittney. Love you. </p>


            <h3 align="right">Yours Truly,</h3>

            <p>PS: This personal message it's for you only to see, therefore it will be automatically deleted in 2 minutes. </p>
